This project is a basic password generator implemented using the C++ programming language. The program generates random passwords based on a user-specified length, helping users create stronger and less predictable passwords for everyday use.

The password generator uses a predefined character set that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols. By randomly selecting characters from this set, the program ensures that each generated password is unique and resistant to simple guessing or brute-force attempts.

User input is handled through the terminal, allowing the user to choose the desired password length. The program then processes this input, applies random number generation, and constructs the password using string manipulation techniques. The final output is displayed directly to the user in a clear and readable format.

This project highlights core C++ concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, random number generation, and basic input/output operations. It also introduces beginners to fundamental security ideas, particularly the importance of randomness and character variety in password creation.

The password generator is lightweight, easy to run, and does not rely on external libraries, making it suitable for learning purposes and small-scale applications. Overall, this project serves as a practical introduction to C++ programming while demonstrating how simple logic can be applied to solve real-world problems related to digital security.
